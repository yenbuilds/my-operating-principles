## YenBuilds Progress Criteria

Positive signals:
- New invariants introduced or strengthened
- Interfaces frozen or clarified
- Complexity moved downward (manual → template → code → invariant)
- Low-energy workflows added (templates, defaults, automation)
- Deletions that reduce surface area

Negative signals:
- Feature explosion without stabilisation
- Parallel systems without a migration plan
- UI polish without backend invariants
- Config sprawl
- Rewrites without constraints

Neutral:
- Refactors that don’t change invariants
- Exploratory spikes (if clearly labelled)
