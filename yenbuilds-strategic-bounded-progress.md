# The Bounded Progress Framework

This framework exists to answer one core question:

> **What is the least damaging way to move forward when constraints collide?**

It is designed to prevent perfection spirals, avoidance loops, and self-override, while preserving momentum.

---

## 1. Separate **Invariants** from **Aspirations**

**Invariants** are non-negotiable system protections. Breaking them has long-term cost.

Examples:
- Weekly upload cadence
- Preserve mental/nervous system stability
- Avoid perfection spirals
- Respect time and energy limits
- Maintain continuity and momentum

**Aspirations** are desirable outcomes, but optional in any given iteration.

Examples:
- Smooth, confident narration
- Comfort on mic
- High polish
- Pride in the result

**Rule:**  
> Invariants always outrank aspirations.

Aspirations are sequenced over time; invariants are preserved every cycle.

---

## 2. When invariants conflict, apply **Scope Reduction**, not Delay

When two invariants appear to conflict (e.g. “ship weekly” vs “don’t self-punish”):

Wrong responses:
- Delay indefinitely
- Force full performance
- Escalate effort or stakes

Correct response:
- **Reduce scope until the conflict disappears**

Examples of scope reduction:
- Less voice instead of more
- Edited voice instead of live narration
- Silence instead of strained filler
- “Practice” framing instead of performance framing

**Rule:**  
> Reduce scope before reducing cadence.

---

## 3. Define **MVP Output** *before* you start

Perfection spirals emerge when “done” is undefined.

### MVP Video Definition
A video is considered shippable if it:
- Is technically valid
- Is honest and not misleading
- Is not actively painful to experience
- Fits within the time/energy budget
- Does not require overriding the nervous system

It does **not** need to be:
- Confident
- Charismatic
- Fluent
- Polished

**Rule:**  
> “Good enough” must be defined in advance, or it will never exist.

---

## 4. Use **Salvage Mode** under constraint

Salvage Mode is a legitimate operating state, not a failure.

### Salvage Mode Rules:
- No re-recording
- No ambition increase mid-stream
- Cut harm; do not add polish
- Silence is preferable to strained output
- Ship the least-damaging viable version

Salvage Mode optimizes for **system survival**, not improvement.

**Rule:**  
> When resources are low, prioritize damage minimisation over progress maximisation.

---

## 5. Apply **Decision Closure**

Leaving decisions emotionally open creates ongoing load.

### Decision Closure Rule:
Once a decision:
- Preserves invariants
- Fits real constraints
- Feels neutral (not punitive)

It is considered **closed**.

No re-litigation.  
No “what if” loops.  
No retroactive self-trial.

**Rule:**  
> Reopening closed decisions is a hidden form of perfectionism.

---

## 6. Encode this as a **Default Policy**

This should not be debated every time.

### Default Output Policy (v1.0)

When producing under constraint:
1. Preserve cadence first  
2. Reduce scope before delaying  
3. Prefer editing over re-recording  
4. Silence is allowed  
5. Salvage beats restart  
6. Ship neutrally, not heroically  

Voice, comfort, and polish improve **after repetition**, not before.

---

## 7. Life-Level Generalisation

This framework applies beyond content creation:
- Work deliverables
- Difficult conversations
- Health routines
- Creative projects
- Social or performance exposure

Unhealthy pattern:
> “If I can’t do it well, I’ll wait or force myself.”

Healthy pattern:
> **“What is the least damaging forward step that preserves momentum?”**

This question prevents burnout, avoidance, and self-betrayal.

---

## 8. Core Philosophy

> **Progress is not about intensity.  
> It is about preserving the ability to continue.**

Standards rise because the system survives.

---

## Final Note

This framework does not lower standards.  
It protects the system that allows standards to rise over time.

This is not emotional self-soothing.  
It is systems engineering for a human operating under constraint.
