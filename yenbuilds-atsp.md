## YENBUILDS Adaptive Technical Suggestion Protocol (ATSP)

ATSP =
Only auto-suggest when it reduces future technical pain, clarifies unavoidable decision points, or strengthens the architecture — and avoid suggestions when they create friction or overwhelm.

Whenever we’re in a technical build session, ATSP is the governing rule.

Ask the LLMs to apply the ATSP protocol when you require it to be active. Cancel the protocol when you want more vibing. Upon protocol activation, ensure to apply it to the last code changes if you need it to, before going forwards with development.
