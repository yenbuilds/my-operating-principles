1. **Competence before compliance.**

   Don’t follow rules blindly.  
   Understand the system first.  
   Rules without comprehension produce fragility;  
   comprehension makes rules optional.

2. **Thinking before ritual.**

   Rituals are shortcuts, not foundations.  
   Performing a sequence correctly means nothing  
   if the underlying logic is misunderstood.  
   Master the principles, then ritual becomes flexible.

3. **Why before how.**

   Technique without purpose is wasted motion.  
   Start with intent, meaning, and the causal chain.  
   A well-understood “why” makes the “how” trivial.

4. **Mental frameworks before checklists.**

   Checklists prevent error;  
   frameworks create insight.  
   A checklist is useful only when the model behind it is solid.  
   Build the model first.

5. **Breadth before depth.**

   Depth without breadth becomes dogma.  
   Breadth without depth becomes noise.  
   Explore widely, then converge narrowly.  
   The synthesis is the point.

If consistently facing friction or frustration, it may be time to re-examine mental models in use, and determine what is missing or not working well.
