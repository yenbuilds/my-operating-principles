## 1. **Competence before compliance.**
Rules are not substitutes for understanding.  
Follow nothing blindly.  
Comprehension creates robustness;  
obedience without comprehension creates fragility.  
Once you understand the system, rules become optional tools—not constraints.

## 2. **Thinking before ritual.**
Rituals are conveniences, not foundations.  
Executing a sequence flawlessly means nothing if the underlying mechanism is unclear.  
Master the principles first; the ritual then becomes adaptable rather than restrictive.

## 3. **Why before how.**
Technique without intent is wasted motion.  
Begin with the purpose, the causal chain, the reason a thing matters.  
Once the “why” is grasped, the “how” becomes either obvious or irrelevant.

## 4. **Frameworks before checklists.**
Checklists prevent mistakes; frameworks generate insight.  
A checklist is only as strong as the model behind it.  
Build the model first—the list will write itself.

## 5. **Breadth before depth.**
Depth without breadth becomes dogma.  
Breadth without depth becomes noise.  
Survey widely, then dive selectively.  
Synthesis—not extremity—is the real objective.

## **Structural Diagnostics: When Things Keep Breaking**
Persistent friction is not a personal failing—it is a signal of structural weakness in the system being used.  
When something repeatedly fails, you don’t need more effort, emotion, or frustration. You need a structural fix.

Address it rationally and immediately.

**Example:**  
If an LLM keeps producing broken markdown, don’t get flustered.  
Build a prompt wrapper, a formatting guard, or a validation step now.  
Small structural repairs prevent exponential future waste.
