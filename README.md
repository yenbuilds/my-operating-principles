**Disclosure & Authorship**

This work was created using a combination of human judgment and AI tools.

I stand behind the ideas and outcomes presented here regardless of the tools used.

VERY IMPORTANT! These ideas are not set in stone. Whenever new ideas hit or if I come into the posession of new knowledge, it may invalidate some of all of the below. Nothing here is held sacred! It's a living, breathing set of principles that can morph with me.

## Core Operating Principles

### 1. Competence before compliance.
Rules are not substitutes for understanding.  
Follow nothing blindly.  
Comprehension creates robustness;  
obedience without comprehension creates fragility.  

Once you understand the system, rules become optional tools — not constraints.

---

### 2. Thinking before ritual.
Rituals are conveniences, not foundations.  
Executing a sequence flawlessly means nothing if the underlying mechanism is unclear.  

Master the principles first; the ritual then becomes adaptable rather than restrictive.

---

### 3. Why before how.
Technique without intent is wasted motion.  
Begin with the purpose, the causal chain, the reason a thing matters.  

Once the “why” is grasped, the “how” becomes either obvious or irrelevant.

---

### 4. Frameworks before checklists.
Checklists prevent mistakes; frameworks generate insight.  
A checklist is only as strong as the model behind it.  

Build the model first.  
The checklist will write itself.

---

### 5. Breadth before depth.
Depth without breadth becomes dogma.  
Breadth without depth becomes noise.  

Survey widely, then dive selectively.  
Synthesis — not extremity — is the objective.

## Structural Diagnostics: Detecting Systemic Failure

Persistent friction is not a personal failing.  
It is a signal of structural weakness in the system being used.

When something repeatedly fails, you do not need:
- More effort  
- More emotion  
- More motivation  
- More frustration  

Those are irrelevant variables.

You need a **structural fix**.

Address the structural problems ASAP.

### Example: Repeated LLM Output Failures

If an LLM keeps producing broken markdown, do not get flustered.  

Instead:
- Add a prompt wrapper  
- Introduce a formatting guard  
- Add a validation or post-processing step  

One small structural repair prevents exponential future waste.

## Design Doctrine: Eliminate Downside First (Invert, Always Invert)

Conventional advice says to double down on strengths.  
This is usually wrong.

Do not ask:
> *“How do I leverage my strengths?”*

Ask instead:
> *“What reliably causes failure — and how do I make that impossible?”*

Strengths only pay off under ideal conditions.  
Weaknesses impose a tax in **every** condition.

Remove bottlenecks instead of chasing upside.  
Design systems that function in low-energy states, not peak motivation.

Eliminate downside. Let upside take care of itself.
