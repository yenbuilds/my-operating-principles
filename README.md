This work was created using a combination of human judgment and AI...
I stand behind the ideas presented here regardless of the tools used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> IMPORTANT! Life is larger than any system or project.
> Family, friends, health, and relationships take precedence over work.
> These principles apply within the context of building, thinking, and creating, and may be overridden when life requires it. This repository is not the place for broader life discourse.

> [!CAUTION]
> CAUTION! These ideas are not set in stone. Whenever new ideas hit or if I come into the posession of new knowledge, it may invalidate some of all of the below. Nothing here is held sacred! It's a living, breathing set of principles that can morph with me. I have found it helpful to try to avoid rigidity of thought. If nothing is ever being deleted, then this repo's as good as dead!
