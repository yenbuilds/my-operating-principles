Adaptive Technical Suggestion Protocol (ATSP)

ATSP =
Only auto-suggest when it reduces future technical pain, clarifies unavoidable decision points, or strengthens the architecture — and avoid suggestions when they create friction or overwhelm.

Whenever we’re in a technical build session, ATSP is the governing rule.
