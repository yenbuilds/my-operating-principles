### Unleveraged Debt

**Unleveraged debt** is any obligation that must be repaid but does **not** increase future capacity, optionality, or compounding advantage.

Debt here is broader than money. It includes **time, energy, reputation, and cognitive load**.

> Unleveraged debt = a cost with downside but no enduring upside.

#### Financial Debt
- Borrowing for consumption
- Funding depreciating or non-productive assets

You incur ongoing obligation without creating income, ownership, or leverage.

---

#### Time Debt
- Fixed commitments that consume hours
- Work that produces no transferable skill
- Roles with no learning curve or artifacts

Time is spent repeatedly with nothing accumulating.

---

#### Energy Debt
- Sustained output without recovery
- Stress that permanently reduces capacity
- Work that drains motivation without growth

Burnout is energy debt with compounding interest.

---

#### Reputation Debt
- Being known for work you do not want to repeat
- Signals that constrain future direction
- Alignment with low-leverage niches

Reputation compounds automatically and is slow to unwind.

---

#### Cognitive Debt
- Systems that require constant mental overhead
- Fragmented attention across too many obligations
- Tools or workflows that demand babysitting

Mental drag silently reduces compounding speed.

---

#### Leveraged vs Unleveraged Test

Debt is acceptable when it:
- Buys learning
- Buys future time
- Buys optionality
- Buys positioning

Ask before committing:

> **When this is over, what remains that makes the next step easier?**

If the answer is “nothing”, it is unleveraged debt.
