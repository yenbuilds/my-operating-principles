## I. Core Philosophy
Extreme INTPs don’t thrive on motivation or discipline. They thrive when friction is removed, activation energy is near zero, context stays warm, and ideas naturally turn into reusable systems. The INTP Compound Engine is an operating system built around these truths.

---

## II. System Overview
The engine contains **four primary organs** supported by a friction-reduction layer:

1. **Idea Intake** — capture everything instantly  
2. **Continuity Loop** — maintain momentum with minimal effort  
3. **Execution Core** — let AI handle heavy lifting  
4. **Compounding Layer** — turn work into reusable assets  

All of it is wrapped in environmental design that makes progress automatic.

## III. The Four Organs

### 1. IDEA INTAKE
INTPs generate endless ideas; the problem is managing them, not producing them.

**Rule:** Every idea goes into one inbox instantly.  
No judging. No sorting. No pressure.

This preserves creativity and prevents mental clutter.

---

### 2. CONTINUITY LOOP
Momentum is not intensity; it’s *warm context*.

**Rule:** 10 minutes counts.  
A tiny improvement, a note, a quick rename, or a question to AI—all of it keeps the project alive in your cognitive field.

This eliminates the massive INTP “cold start penalty.”

---

### 3. EXECUTION CORE
INTPs dislike repetitive execution and lose momentum the moment tasks become mechanical.

**AI handles:**  
- Task decomposition  
- Drafting and code  
- Structural design  
- Summaries, refactors  
- Debugging  
- Memory and continuity  

**You handle:**  
- Sense-making  
- Steering and decisions  
- Conceptual architecture  
- Refinement

This shifts you into your natural zone while AI absorbs the grunt work.

---

### 4. COMPOUNDING LAYER
Every action should become an asset that improves future work.

Convert everything into reusable modules:  
- Code blocks  
- Templates  
- Prompts  
- Diagrams  
- Mental models  
- Workflows  

**Principle:** If you do something twice, systemise it once.

This is what turns linear effort into exponential acceleration.

---

## IV. The Three-Track Limit
INTPs scatter when overloaded, so impose a structural constraint.

**Only 3 active tracks at once:**  
1. **Main Compounding Project**  
2. **Support Project**  
3. **Play Project** (for novelty & energy)

Everything else lives in the sandbox. This preserves flow without killing curiosity.

---

## V. Sandbox Layer
A protected zone for idea exploration.

**Weekly filter:**  
1. Does it have long-term compounding potential?  
2. Is the interest more than a 24-hour spike?

If yes → promote to execution.  
If no → archive guilt-free.  
This keeps entropy under control.

---

## VI. Friction Reduction Layer
Where progress is usually lost. The engine fixes this structurally.

Use:  
- Default templates  
- Prebuilt scaffolds  
- Clean file structures  
- One-click launchers  
- Auto session logs  
- Always-open environments  
- AI recaps of last session  
- Simple modular architecture  

Your environment does the work; your brain does the thinking.

---

## VII. Retrospective Scoring
INTPs perform poorly under live pressure. So remove it.

**Rule:** Ship first. Evaluate afterward.

After each deliverable:  
- Score what worked  
- Score what failed  
- Update templates  
- Refine the system  

Continuous improvement without emotional friction.

---

## VIII. The INTP Growth Loop
Running the engine creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

```
Ideas → Systems → Assets → Reuse → Faster Output → More Ideas → Better Systems → Stronger Assets → …
```

Output becomes faster, cleaner, more elegant, and more connected over time.

---

## IX. AI as Cognitive Multiplier
AI is not a tool. It is the INTP’s second cognitive hemisphere.

AI provides:  
- Structure  
- Continuity  
- Execution power  
- Error-checking  
- Low-friction progress  
- Memory for scattered threads  
- Options, clarity, and scaffolding  

It multiplies strengths and neutralises weak points.

---

## X. Prime Directive
**Design the system so progress continues even in low-energy states.**

If your progress depends on “motivated you,” the system is weak.  
If progress happens even when tired, bored, stressed, or scattered, the system is perfect.

---

## XI. Axioms of the INTP Compound Engine
- Lower friction → higher output  
- No discipline needed → just environment design  
- No forced focus → use a 3-track cap  
- No productivity hacks → use continuity  
- No need to finish everything → make assets compound  
- No rigid structure → outsource structure to AI  
- No guilt for exploration → sandbox is part of the system

## XII. Slogan
**“Small nudges, infinite leverage.”**
