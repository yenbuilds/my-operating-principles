# YenBuilds Productivity Framework  
**Unifying High-Idea Creativity with Compounding Execution**  
v1.0

# 🌳 1. The Master Spine Model
All projects, ideas, and experiments fall into one of four categories:

## **1. Spine (Core System)**
These MUST compound. They define the long-term value of YenBuilds.

**Rule:** If it strengthens the spine, it gets priority.

## **2. Branches (Extensions of the Spine)**
These enhance the spine but don’t define it.  

**Rule:** Branches only grow AFTER the spine’s trunk is stable.

## **3. Vines (Growth & Network Effects)**
These leverage community and social loops.  

**Rule:** Vines are built strategically to amplify reach and stickiness.

## **4. Spores / CEPs (Creative Energy Projects)**
CEPs = Creative Energy Projects. These are not obligations — they exist to PREVENT burnout and generate novelty.  

**Rule:** CEPs exist to restore energy, not to generate progress. They cannot replace Spine sessions.

# 🔄 2. Daily Workflow (Three-Loop Discipline)

## **Morning: Spine Work (Deep Output)**
- 45–90 minutes
- No side projects
- No interruptions
- One meaningful unit of progress
- This is where compounding happens

## **Afternoon: Branch/Vine Work (Optional)**
- Expand features
- Improve UX
- Document systems
- Light code refactors
- Prepare for next ML stage

## **Evening: CEP / Spores (Creative Restoration)**
- 30–60 minutes
- Fun only
- No expectations
- No follow-on tasks
- Emotional win over completeness

# 🧠 3. Idea Intake → Sorting Pipeline

Decision Tree:  
1. **Does this strengthen the Spine?**  
→ YES → Prioritise and schedule.  
→ NO ↓  
2. **Does it extend an existing Branch without diluting focus?**  
→ YES → Add to Branch roadmap.  
→ NO ↓  
3. **Does it act as a Vine (growth, community, network effects)?**  
→ YES → Tag as Vine. Build later.  
→ NO ↓  
4. **Is it a CEP (Creative Energy Project)?**  
→ YES → Add to CEP area. Limit daily time.  
→ NO → Archive for later review.

# 🔥 5. Rules for CEPs (Creative Energy Projects)

CEPs must follow strict boundaries:
1. Max 1–2 active at a time  
2. Never done before Spine work  
3. Time-boxed: 30–60 minutes  
4. No guilt if abandoned  
5. Must produce a small, fun win  
6. No ongoing obligations  
7. ALL CEP output saved in `/cep/`  
8. Never allowed to derail next-day Spine sessions

# 🧩 6. Weekly Review Process (30 Minutes)

## **1. Spine Audit**
- What part of the spine grew this week?
- What was delayed, and why?
- Does the roadmap need replanning?

## **2. Branch Status**
- Any branches becoming too large?
- Should one be paused to protect the spine?

## **3. CEP Check**
- Did CEPs energise you?
- Did any become obligations?
- Archive or continue as needed.

## **4. Network Effects Scan**
- Did any Vine ideas emerge this week?
- Which offer the highest community payoff?

## **5. Recommit to Spine Priorities for Next Week**
- Choose 1–2 spine milestones only.

# 🧲 7. The Guiding Principle
**Side projects are for energy, not progress.  
The spine is for progress, not energy.  
Your job is to keep both loops healthy.**

# 🌀 8. Optional Automation Hooks (Future)
- AI classifier sorts ideas into Spine/Branch/Vine/CEP  
- Daily auto-summary of work done  
- CEP randomisation wheel  
- Telemetry logs → Spine priority suggestions  
- Weekly retrospect tool  
- Repo-standardised PR templates (Spine PR / Branch PR / Vine PR / CEP PR)

# 🛠 9. Example Day

**09:00–10:00 → Spine**  
- Implement overlay refinement

**13:00–15:00 → Branch/Vine**  
- Improve Discord bot 

**20:00–21:00 → CEP**  
- Generate 6 comic panels of my film
- Experiment with Dutch-sounding nonsense patterns
