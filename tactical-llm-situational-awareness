Whenever I say SITREP, it means "Tell me in a short sentence where we are now" . Add this to copilot isntructions. And also clean up the copilot instructions - making sure all of it is relavant to the current #codebase

Searched codebase and updated copilot instructions
I’ll open the existing Copilot instructions to see what’s there, then update them to document “SITREP” and trim anything that’s not relevant to this repo.

Updated conventions
Edited
copilot-instructions.md+4-0
I’ve updated the Copilot instructions in copilot-instructions.md to:

Define “SITREP” as: respond with a single short sentence summarizing the current state of work, with no extra detail or headings.
Clarify that instructions are specific to this MSFS telemetry + overlay codebase and its workflows, so responses stay grounded in this repo rather than generic boilerplate.
From now on, when you say “SITREP”, I’ll follow that convention.
